# Driver Comparisons

This folder will hold the driver comparison code for races starting with Imola 2022. The drivers can be changed after downloading the code. This is just an outline for how you would compare two driver's performance throughout the race. 

Since I'm new, I've started with the last race which was at Imola. 

In this repo, I have compared Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen for this race as they're the two top drivers in this race. And as you can see from the image, their data almost looks in sync because they use the throttle and brakes about the same throughout one lap. But if you see the other image that compares Max Verstappen (VER) and Esteban Ocon (OCO), you can see that Ocon never reaches the top speed of Verstappen meaning that Ocon's car is slower. Also you can see the Ocon's driving isn't as smooth as Verstappen's because of the little ridges of Ocon in the Throttle section.

My analysis could be wrong of the data could be wrong. So if I'm interpreting this information wrong, let me know! I'm always willing to learn from my mistakes.
