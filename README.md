# F1 Data Analysis

## Description
I've recently become an F1 fan due to the Netflix show "Formula 1: Drive to Survive". As a computer engineer graduate, it's peaked my interest in how the car is developed and the data analysis ran on it throughout the season. So I wanted to learn more about it and found that there is a library called "FastF1" in Python that helps in data analysis by providing everything you need such as loading a specific race to loading a specific car's data. 

This library, FastF1, is built around the Pandas dataframe and Series objects. And I'll mostly be using this library to do driver comparisons race to race and analyzing their performance. 

**I will be expanding this repository to car comparisons and track data.**

Since learning more about Formula 1 data analysis, it's made me enjoy the sport even more!
